        <h5>COOKIE POLICY OF CORONA TEST CENTRE</h5>
        <p> This document informs you about the technologies that help Corona Test Centre to achieve the purposes described below.
              Such technologies allow us (X Medical Ltd, 224 Shoreditch High St, London, E1 6PJ) to access and 
              store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on your device as you interact with Corona Test Centre.</p>
        <p> For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.</p>
        <p> For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of
             mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where
              it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.</p>
        <p>	Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require your consent, depending on the applicable law.
             Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>
        <p>	Corona Test Centre uses Trackers managed directly by us (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services
             provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party 
             providers may access the Trackers managed by them.</p>
        <p>	The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime
             set by us or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of your browsing session.</p>
        <p> In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below,
             you may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well 
             as any other relevant information – such as the presence of other Trackers - 
             in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting us at hello@coronatestcentre.com.</p>
